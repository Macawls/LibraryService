Problem: Library Management System

Design and implement a library management system in a Programming Language of your choice. Your system should include the following features:

Book Management:
‚úÖ	Add a new book to the library.
‚úÖ	Remove a book from the library.
‚úÖ	Search for a book by title or author.
‚úÖ	Display all books available in the library.

Member Management:
‚úÖ	Add a new member to the library.
‚úÖ	Remove a member from the library.
‚úÖ	Display all library members.

Borrowing System:
	Allow members to borrow books.
	Check if a book is available for borrowing.
	Keep track of borrowed books and their due dates.
	Allow members to return books.

Fine System:
	Implement a fine system for late returns.
	Calculate fines based on the number of days a book is overdue.

Data Persistence:
	Implement file handling to save and load library data, including books, members, and borrowing records.
		- Use JSON or write Binary data to a file 

User Interface:
	Create a user-friendly interface to interact with the library system, do not use Console Input and Output

Error Handling:
	Handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring the program does not crash due to invalid user inputs or file handling errors.
		- Only use Exceptions when needed, try to avoid overuse

Optional Features:
	Additional features like book categorization, reservation system, backend-api, unit tests, or multi-threading for concurrent operations can be added for extra challenge.
